I am a data scientist / full stack developer with 8 years industry and startup experience, I provide business strategy along with technical solutions. Currently, I am the data scientist in 17 media, the top-1 live casting company based in Taiwan.  

I built machine learning applications, including:  
    * Recommender system  
    * CTR (click-through-rate) predicting model  
    * Ad-campaign performance predicting model  
    * Native Ads Classifier  
    * Realtime News Classifier  
    * User checkIns prediction model  
    * Deep-learning dialog model  

I built BI dashboard which:  
    * Help marketing teams decide strategy through data insight and boost revenue.  
    * Process from raw log to visualized charts.  
    * Built upon cloud services: AWS, GCP, Linode, Azure.  
    * Integrate data pipelines including SQL/NoSQL, BigQuery, Spark/Hive/Hadoop.  

Beyond being a well-trained engineer, I was an entrepreneur. In the past few years, I join the largest startup incubator AppWorks in Taiwan. Been worked with startups in many different kinds of fields, I gained various domain knowledge like e-commerce, media, digital ads and mobile apps.  

I love making new friends and sharing industry experiences, feel free to chat :)
