I am a senior engineer with 9-years industry experience, currently working as a **Data Scientist** for 17 media, the top-1 mobile live-casting company in Taiwan. 


I built **machine learning applications**, includes: 
* Recommder system
* CTR (click-through-rate) predicting model
* Ad-campaign performance predicting model
* [Native Ads Classifier](https://github.com/Marsan-Ma/tnative)
* News categorizer model
* [User checkIns prediction](https://github.com/Marsan-Ma/checkins)
* [Deep-learning dialog model](https://github.com/Marsan-Ma/tf_chatbot_seq2seq_antilm)

I am also good at **web applications**, I built web dashboard which: 
* Visualize data by through D3.js
* Combine data sources including: 
    1. SQL (mysql, postgres)
    2. NoSQL (mongoDB, redis) 
    3. others (spark, bigquery) 
    4. raw server log (by self ETL)



Beyond being a well-trained engineer, I was an entrepreneur. I could provide business strategy along with technical solutions. In the past few years, I join the largest startup incubator [AppWorks](https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/17/appworks-50m/) in Taiwan. Having been worked with several startups in many different kinds of fields, I gained various domain knowledge like e-commerce, media, digital ads and mobile apps.

I love making new friends and sharing latest industries experiences, feel free to contact me :)
