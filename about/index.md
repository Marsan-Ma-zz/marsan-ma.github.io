I am a senior engineer with 8-years industry experience, currently working as a **Data Scientist** for 17 media, the top-1 mobile live-casting company in Taiwan. 


### I built machine learning applications, includes:  
* Recommder system  
* CTR (click-through-rate) predicting model  
* Ad-campaign performance predicting model  
* [Native Ads Classifier](https://github.com/Marsan-Ma/tnative)

* [Deep-learning dialog model](https://github.com/Marsan-Ma/tf_chatbot_seq2seq_antilm)  


### I built web dashboard which:  
* Visualize data through [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)  
* Combine data sources including:

Beyond being a well-trained engineer, I was an entrepreneur. I could provide business strategy along with technical solutions. In the past few years, I join the largest startup incubator [AppWorks](https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/17/appworks-50m/) in Taiwan. Been worked with startups in many different kinds of fields, I gained various domain knowledge like e-commerce, media, digital ads and mobile apps.

I love making new friends and sharing industry experiences, feel free to chat :)
